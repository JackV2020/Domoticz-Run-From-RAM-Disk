Standard when an update does not work because it thinks there is something wrong with your Internet connection it asks you to come back later.

When that issue persists login as pi and:

 - cd domoticz
 - sudo ./updaterelease

HOWEVER ALSO NOTE THAT:

Why does my update not take any effect?

Before an update Domoticz is stopped.

Next the update is done.

After the update Domoticz is started again.

NOTE.. 

The changes to /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh save the active situation after a stop....

And retrieves that before the actual start....

...this will be overwrite the performed update.

Before you start the update put some #-signs before the rsync commands in your /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh.

And remove them after the update.
